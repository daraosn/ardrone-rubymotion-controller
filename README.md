1) Install dependencies and bundles with ```bundle install``` and then ```pod setup```
2) Compile the app to your device with ```rake device``` or run it locally with ```rake```
3) Connect your device to the AR Drone wifi network and run the app
4) Press TAKE OFF and fly your drone

- Left Joystick controls Throttle and Rotation
- Right Joystick controls Forward/Backward and Left/Right

For this example, buttons have been taken from the AR Drone open source example FreeFlight App. And the background texture from the great site www.subtlepatterns.com
